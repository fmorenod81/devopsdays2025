After following the requirements (OCI Account), you have to enter to the Web Console.

Create a compartment where you have to create your Autonomous Database, you can follow this [instructions](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/integration-cloud/oracle-integration-oci/creating-oci-compartment.html) and find his [Compartment OCID](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/contactingsupport_topic-Locating_Oracle_Cloud_Infrastructure_IDs.htm#Finding_the_OCID_of_a_Compartment)


##  Lab 1 Task 1

Click on the [Cloud Shell](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/devcloudshellgettingstarted.htm), top rigth corner.

clone this repo using 
```
git clone https://github.com/fmorenod81/devopsdays2025.git
```
Go to the folder: 
```
cd ./devopsdays2025/tf

Modify the compartment OCID parameter on ```terraform.tfvars```, you can use vi as text editor.

Initialize Terraform

##  Lab 1 Task 3

Optional to review access using SQL Options.

##  Lab 2 Task 1

On the same folder of tf, you get variables (same password as optional, and Autonomous Database ID) using
```
export adb_ocid=$(terraform output adb_ocid| tr -d '"')
```
```
export adb_password=$(terraform output adb_password| tr -d '"')
```
The replacement will be done automatically on 
```
oci db autonomous-database generate-wallet --generate-type ALL --file Wallet_APEXworkshop.zip --password [Insert Password] --autonomous-database-id [Insert OCID]
```

using 

```
cd ~
```

```
oci db autonomous-database generate-wallet --generate-type ALL --file Wallet_APEXworkshop.zip --password $adb_password --autonomous-database-id $adb_ocid
```
Review that your file Wallet_APEXworkshop.zip is located on your current folder using ```ls -la```

##  Lab 2 Task 2
